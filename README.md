# ZeroWaste

The project integrates two key concepts: food waste management and personalized recipe generation based on user preferences.

The primary goal is to reduce food waste by helping users utilize ingredients before they expire. Instead of offering generic or repetitive recipes, the system suggests customized recipes tailored to each user’s unique taste profile.

For instance, if a user has several food items nearing expiration, the application will provide personalized recipe recommendations that creatively use those ingredients ensuring the meals are both enjoyable and waste-free.

## Main Features

* **Login/signup page:** Where we will authorize users before they can access the feature of the application, also if users account do not exist then do a sign up.

* **Dashboard page::** In the dashboard we would like to show how many food items we have, how many items are near to expire soon, and also can show which food we have to buy again.

* **Food inventory page:** Where we will store the food that has been bought by customer to keep track of the item, 
This will show in table format where we will store food name, food count/weight, food expiration date.

* **Recipe recommendation page:** Based upon the user's preference we will suggest recipes to the user so they make their favourite cuisine by using those food items which will expire soon/in inventory in near future.

* **User preference page:** Where we take user Diet, Allergies, Cuisine Type, Min Calories and Max calories for their food preference.
